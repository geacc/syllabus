% \about{Fish make up the largest group of vertebrates on the planet, easily
% outnumbering mammals, marsupials, birds, and reptiles combined. Not only
% are they abundant, but they've diversified into an extraordinary array of
% sizes, shapes, lifestyles, and habitats. You can find them in the coldest,
% deepest parts of the ocean, and in the hottest freshwater ponds in the desert.
% This course will explore fish diversity and their biology. }

%to add more questions or remove this section, go to the .cls file and start with

\qOne{Do we dissect real fish in this course?}
\aOne{Yes, we do actually dissect fish. If you know of any issues that may cause
  you difficulties during dissections, please notify your TA ASAP.}

\qTwo{What is a fish?}
\aTwo{No clue. When someone says `fish', we have a picture of a general fish of
  a general shape in our minds, but the truth is that `fish' doesn't have
  scientific meaning. Here's a funny video about that:
  \href{https://youtu.be/uhwcEvMJz1Y}{Youtube (hyperlink)}. }

\qThree{What is your favorite fish?}
\aThree{A lumpsucker. They are incredibly, adorably weird-looking.}

\qFour{What's the difference between plural `fish' and `fishes'?}
\aFour{`Fish' is the plural form when talking about two or more fish of the same
  species. `Fishes' is the plural when talking about two or more different
  species.}

\section{Sobre o GEACC}

O \emph{Grupo de Estudos Avançados em Ciência da Computação (GEACC)} é
formado por alunos de Ciência da Computação (ou outra área relacionada) da
FAESA Centro Universitário.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%	 OBJETIVO
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vspace{0.5cm} 
\section{Objetivo}

Estudar tópicos avançados em Ciência da Computação, principalmente relacionados
a \emph{matemática} (contínua, discreta e concreta), \emph{algoritmos e
estruturas de dados} (fundamentais e avançados) e \emph{aplicações} (científicas,
data science, machine learning e outras), com o objetivo específico de preparar
os alunos participantes para alcançar nota $\ge 8.5$ na prova POSCOMP de 2021 (o
que corresponde a acertar pelo menos 60 das 70 questões da prova).

%	 GRADING SCHEME
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Grading Scheme}

% Below is the \twentyshort environment - a list with only two inputs. However,
% there is a \twenty environment, which creates a list with four inputs. You can
% find/alter details of that table in the .cls file c. lines 320. 
\begin{twentyshort}
	%\twentyitemshort{X\%}{Attendance/Participation}
	\twentyitemshort{15\%}{Review Paper}
	\twentyitemshort{15\%}{Lab Worksheets}
    \twentyitemshort{40\%}{Midterm Exams, 20\% each}
    \twentyitemshort{30\%}{Final Exam}
\end{twentyshort}

Grades will follow the standard scale: A = 89.5-100; B = 79.5-89.4; C = 69.5-79.4;
D = 60-69.4; F $<$60. Curving is at the discretion of the professor.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Review Paper}

Students will choose a scientific article concerning a topic or species that we
covered in class. For this assignment, you will write a summary of the paper and
a review: strengths of the paper, things they could improve, perhaps any holes
that they did not address, etc. You will then give your review to two classmates
to independently review, and you will incorporate their edits into your final
draft. You will turn in an abstract of the original paper, the two peer-reviewed
copies of your review, the names of people whose papers you reviewed, and your
final draft. 15\% of your grade will depend on how thoughtfully and thoroughly
you reviewed your peers' papers.   

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Learning Objectives}

% use \begin{outline} or \begin{outline}[enumerate] to create a list with subitems. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Become familiar with the evolutionary history and taxonomic diversity
  of fishes
\item Improve your understanding of the basic physiological and behavioral
  adaptations of fishes
\item Gain skills regarding the dissection, collection, and preservation of fish
  specimens through laboratory work
\item Learn to critically review a paper and summarize it, as well as review and
  provide helpful criticism to your peers' work
\end{itemize}

\section{Make-up Policy}

Make-up exams or assignments will only be allowed for students who have a
substantiated excuse approved by the instructor \emph{before the due date}.
Leaving a phone message or sending an e-mail without confirmation is not
acceptable. Labs are mandatory. Make-ups for missing a lab consists of a 1
paragraph summary of a recent fish-oriented journal article highlighted in the
news AND a 4 minute power point presentation on the article to the class. Any
additional missed labs will result in zero credit for that lab.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Diversity and Inclusivity Statement}

I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect,
and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities,
genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious
affiliations, sexual orientations, ability - and other visible and non-visible
differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a
respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of
the class. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Accommodations for Students with Disabilities}

If you are a student with learning needs that require special accommodation,
contact the Office of Disability Services at 555-5555 or theiremail@email.com,
as soon as possible, to make an appointment to discuss your special needs and
to obtain an accommodations letter.  Please e-mail me as soon as possible in
order to set up a time to discuss your learning needs.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Academic Integrity}

The University Code of Academic Integrity is central to the ideals of this
course. Students are expected to be independently familiar with the Code and to
recognize that their work in the course is to be their own original work that
truthfully represents the time and effort applied.  Violations of the Code are
most serious and will be handled in a manner that fully represents the extent
of the Code and that befits the seriousness of its violation.\\
